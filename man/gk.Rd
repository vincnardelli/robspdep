\title{Permutation test for GK statistic}
\usage{
gk(x, listw, alternative = "greater", nsim = 999)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric vector the same length as the neighbours list in spdep listw}

\item{listw}{a \code{listw} object created with spdep for example by \code{spdep::nb2listw}}

\item{alternative}{alternative a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis, must be "greater" (default), or "less".}

\item{nsim}{number of permutations}
}
\value{
A list with \code{statistic}, \code{p.value} and \code{res}
}
\description{
A permutation test for GK statistic calculated by using nsim random
permutations of x for the given spatial weighting scheme generated with spdep,
to establish the rank of the observed statistic in relation to the nsim simulated values.
}
\examples{
gk(sampledata$x,sampledata$w)
}
