\description{
Data is generated considering a 10-by-10 regular square lattice grid where data is generated by
a spatial autoregressive process with a strong spatial correlation parameter (rho = 0.7)
obtained by filtering a random sample generated by 100 independent standard normal distributions.
The outcoming x variable is associated to a Moran test of 0.65 which is highly significant (p-value < 2.2e-16)
The variable y is then contaminated with just one single outlier (=50) located in the upper left corner.
The new map is now characterized by a much lower value of the  Moran test of (0.199) which is not significant (p-value = 0.42).
Therefore the presence of a single ouliers totally rubs off the strong spatial correlation structure
that was evident before the contamination.
