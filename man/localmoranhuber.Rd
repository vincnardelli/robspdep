\title{Local Moran-Huber's I statistic}
\usage{
localmoranhuber(x, listw, nsim = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric vector the same length as the neighbours list in spdep listw}

\item{listw}{a \code{listw} object created with spdep for example by \code{spdep::nb2listw}}

\item{nsim}{number of permutations}
}
\value{
A list with letters and numbers.
\itemize{
\item Ii - local moran-huber statistic
\item E.Ii	- permutation sample mean
\item Var.Ii - permutation sample standard deviation
\item Z.Ii - permutation sample means and standard deviations
\item Pr - P-value
}
}
\description{
The local spatial statistic Moran-Huber's I is calculated for each zone based on the spatial weights object used.
The values returned include a Z-value, and may be used as a explorative analysis tool.
}
\examples{
localmoranhuber(sampledata$x, sampledata$w)
